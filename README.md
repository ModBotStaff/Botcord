# Botcord
Botcord, a visual representation of OAuth applications in Discord, helps you see how healthy your bot is. You can host it at any web host that supports HTML, CSS and JS files.

User tokens MAY have some significant issues as I've only focused on bot accounts for now. 

Also, to the Discord developers, if you don't feel comfortable with the style sheet used, feel free to contact me. I'll take it down upon request.
